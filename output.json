Outside of trails, cyclists aren't allowed to use sidewalks (seriously, has anyone ever even had a problem with cyclists on sidewalks?), motorists don't treat cyclists as legitimate traffic (I've even had police cars illegally pass me in an intersection), bike lanes aren't safe (filled with debris, illegally parked cars, makes cyclists ambiguous traffic, etc), bike-friendly trails suddenly turn into bike-forbidden sidewalks, and so on. Either make it clear that cyclists are legit road traffic and enforce laws equally, or give cyclists all the same rights as pedestrians. If you want the ambiguous middle ground that we currently have, then we need physically separate bike lanes everywhere.

If they asked people to \"keep to the right\" and reminded folks to signal. If they offered to grease a rusty chain. I know more people who ride in far less safe spaces just to avoid them than I do who actually go get helmets. The trailway is the safest area in the city for riding. Beyond the trail patrol, I tend to feel strongly that driver awareness and education is the most important thing we can think about in this space. Cars need to know when it's safe to pass cyclists. They need to know to use their turn signals. And cyclists need to know how to use turn signals and safely take lanes when they're riding in the road. There's so much more education to impart to people than \"wear a helmet and use lights/reflectors\". It won't be until we start to bridge the adversarial gap between motorists and cyclists that we'll see safer riding conditions in our city."},

A major problem with a city built on a hill is getting up and down the hill. A graduated, safe trail or bike route that lets people switchback up and down a hill to make it more managable would be a huge help. The disjointed set of trails leading from Kimble/Wilsey up to Bliss Carmen school is an excellent example of one such system, on a mix of roads and quiet trails. 2) Fredericton roads and drivers are simple not built for cycling traffic - as a former road rider/frequent commuter, near-misses with cars (including two \"grazes\" - one that sent me flying from my bike) have left me wary of being on roads with any significant traffic. Bike lanes are no more than painted lines that are too-frequently populated by ignorant pedestrians (especially on Canterbury Drive). I'm not sure that a major initiative to increase commuter cycling is likely to be fruitful, and for recreational use, the current trail system is spectacular."},

While I am comfortable with traffic, I believe bike only infrastructure would be of benefit to users not comfortable with traffic, and would be beneficial to all. Anything that helps people get out of their vehicles and get on a bike is a good thing. Also as a cyclist of many years I am not convinced bike lanes do much as they are today. A combination of factors makes them unsafe (debris, grates, parked cars). I can say I'm not even sure where they are painted other than a few locations, and they just stop at random points anyway. Cars seem to pass me with much less clearance when they think I'm in a lane of some kind (even just a white line). When I'm more firmly on the road I seem to get more notice and clearance from vehicles. I also seem to get passed when it is not appropriate (i.e. when my speed is same as traffic) when I’m way over in a bike lane, or far to the right. Bad drivers are my largest concern today, not infrastructure. Infrastructure will help those not comfortable with traffic the most (and have biggest impact as far as increasing uptake of active transportation I believe). That being said, I doubt local drivers will be able to correctly navigate streets with additional barriers, as evidenced by their traffic circle confusion."},

The city should be building strategy and planning around this. There is a great need to increase cycling safety to increase use. This includes education of vehicle drivers and cyclists (greater road rule respect)."},

Everything is a fight and that fight cannot be a deterrent for the city to make a positive change in the environment. People think it's crazy to bike to work or to the store because 'we have cars to drive'. Parking is too inexpensive to the point people drive to the trails to have a leisurely strole on their bikes. How weird is that?! We need change. Not only for our health, but also for the Earth as well as the benefits it gives to the aging population, cycling is fantastic for them because it helps with balance. Not everyone will want to cycle and that's fine but it should not be a city where everyone is so scared to be on the road that they bike on the sidewalk, or that there is a social belief that only vehicles are allowed on the street. I should not be biking and have people yell \"you're not a car\" at me while I am LEAGALLY allowed on the street. No nonesense either of, cross the bridge on the sidewalk (encouraged by some police officers) because cars are zipping by like 60km/h will get them past the red light up ahead. We need a shift and this is a great start. It just needs to be implemented and pushed for. There is not a strong advacacy group in Fredericton but there is a great need for some intervention to happen with our expanding waist lines... I look forward to seeing what comes out of this!! Stick it to the motorists (in a pleasent, we want to be friends kind of way)."},

The one I notice most is more of a \"bigger picture\" defect. Bike lanes are nice, and maybe separate lanes are in some sense an ideal; but a problem with them is that if there's no commitment to maintaining them, they're always full of debris. That's the situation in Fredericton. Also, Fredericton's road shoulders seem to be especially poorly maintained, in that they're often very uneven and full of pavement gaps and sunken utility holes and such. Look at Rookwood or Woodstock Rd for example. If the bike lane or farthest right part of the road is uneven and full of debris, a cyclist's safest option is to ride more than 1 m from the curb, which sometimes creates conflict with drivers who don't understand why the cyclist isn't hugging the curb. As a cyclist, I suspect I'd be better off with fewer bike lanes, but with something like sharrows or \"share the road\" signage on roads that are wide enough to accommodate bikes while allowing cars to safely pass. On Regent St and Hanwell, for example, there are no bike lanes but there's plenty of room for everyone. Also, on the \"practical reality\" front: the trail patrol. I'd agree that some kind of enforcement of trail safety and etiquette is a good idea, but in practice the people available for hire in that role don't have the skills to be effective. They just annoy people and do sketchy stuff in the middle of the trail, thereby creating more risk. So why not rethink the job, hire students to do something good but slightly easier so they can succeed: trail ambassadors or somesuch."},

Bikes and cars don't jive well in my mind. If a car hits a cyclist, they can die, the car will be unharmed. But sharing a sidewalk? If a bike hits a pedestrian, there might be a bum? A bruise? Right? I think pedestrians and cyclists are more compatible that cyclists/motorists. However, it is rude to bike on a sidewalk downtown during say, a crowded lunch hour? Then it's best to just get off the bike and walk it for a bit. But like, say it's the evening and you only run into a few people... then the sidewalk can be shared. As long as the cyclist is respectful of their surroundings and the people around them. I guess the problem that necessitates the bylaw is that most people are not respectful. I am very polite when I bike on the sidewalk but that is not always the case. In June of 2010 I saw a truck hit a cyclist near the corner of Westmorland/Brunswick. Truck took a right hand turn really fast, didn't see the cyclist. The girl was bloodied up bad. I was walking on the opposite side of the street... the scene was horrifying though. Only the girls arms were not underneath the truck, then he backed up a bit (with other people directing him) the they tried to pull her out. Blood everywhere. Also, like I said I've had a couple of close calls and cyclists getting hit are in the news almost monthly. So yeah... scary to bike on the road!  Also... please re-think the mandatory helmet bylaw. They don't help. They're styrofoam. They create an illusion of protection. They put out a message the biking is something dangerous when really it would make more sense to wear helmets in a car. Also, adult should be responsible for their own safety choices.
