# one-page-report

Description
===========

This repo serves as a template for Milieu's reports. There are three goals in mind:

- for any new client we can simply plug their .csv file into watson
- the watson-parser can take any question (column) and retrieve the keywords
- put the data back into a .csv file

We can then pick which graphical representation best fits the data using libraries or working with excel graphs.
